    "> We define Internal Covariate Shift as the change in the distribution of network activations due to the change in network parameters during training.\n",

    "In neural networks, the output of the first layer feeds into the second layer, the output of the second layer feeds into the third, and so on. When the parameters of a layer change, so does the distribution of inputs to subsequent layers.\n",

    "These shifts in input distributions can be problematic for neural networks, especially deep neural networks that could have a large number of layers.\n",
